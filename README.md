Here you can see the complete Code of my old discord.py bot.

This will not updated in the future, because i do not work on this bot anymore.
<br>
If you want, you can use my code, for your bot.
<br><br>
The only things you need is a IDE (i recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/)), [python](https://www.python.org/) and [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) installed on your PC.
<br><br>
You can quickly setup your bot, in which you are replacing `BOT_TOKEN` against the Token of your Bot and `PREFIX` with your Prefix
